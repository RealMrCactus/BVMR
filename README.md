# BVMR
Replaces bitlife monitization vars.

[Download](https://github.com/RealMrCactus/BVMR/releases/tag/release)

It's open-source!
You literally just replace JwIT with NwIT at all instances.

# Usage
Drag and drop the file onto the executable then put it back into your bitlife folder thing also remove LiveDictionary.

To get the files i like [MiX](https://xdaforums.com/t/app-2-2-mixplorer-v6-x-released-fully-featured-file-manager.1523691/post-23109280) (The dark theme is great)




I'll make a linux build whenever i hop onto my arch installation again.
